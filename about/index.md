I'm a software engineer that also dabbles in design and product management. I believe the most powerful use of technology is uplifting those most in need.

I graduated from the University of Waterloo with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. During my undergrad, I had technical internships at companies like Facebook, SigOpt, and Kik. For more details, [**check out my resume**](/assets/Eric_Bai_Resume.pdf).

## Past Projects

### Xcerpt
I independently designed and coded Xcerpt, an app for sharing eye-catching excerpts of web articles on Twitter. Xcerpt has over 4000 downloads and was featured by The New York Times, Wired, Gizmodo, and more. The app was personally recommended by Gina Trapani, the founder of Lifehacker, on the show All About Android.

In 2017, Xcerpt was taken down due to increased costs of operation. I hope to eventually re-release it when it is financially feasible.
